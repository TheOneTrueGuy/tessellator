The idea behind this code and text is to find a decent way to explore and volumize a concept space from a single or few concepts
which are arranged as axis or linear relationships and then either perpendicular and/or supernominal concepts are establsihed in 
a graph network around these seed cencepts. One a primary (depth-of-n) graph is created I want to add a visual interface that would allow
the selection of distant graph nodes so that the concept space between them could be spanned by an interpolation process and the intervening
encoding/embedded spaces could be extracted by reverse token look-up.

I would also like to either replace or augment the LLM by turning each concept subject heading into an embedding so that exactly geometric relationships 
could be established if possible.
